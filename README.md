This code to convert from Binary to decimal or word. Or even the other way around.
This can simplify the need to go online to convert and if you have this code you can just bring this around to communicate in secret~

(import tkinter as tk)
Using a special toolbox of code called tkinter. It’s like a kit that helps make windows and buttons in our program.

Clearing Output:
We also have a function called clear_output(). This one just cleans up the space where the result appears.

Input Field:
Then we create a spot where you can type in numbers, words or decimals. It's like a text box.

1) **tkinter is Installation:**

Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

	python -m tkinter

If a window with a button appears (even if it’s a simple window), then tkinter is already installed and available on your system.

If you get an error message, it might indicate that tkinter is not installed or accessible. In that case, you might need to install it based on your operating system.

If you don’t have Python installed, make sure to download and install it from the official Python website: Python Downloads.

3) **Install tkinter on Linux/Ubuntu:**

On some Linux distributions, tkinter might not be installed by default. You can install it using the following command:

	[ sudo apt-get install python3-tk ]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) **Install tkinter on macOS:**

tkinter is typically included in the default Python installation on macOS. However, if you face any issues, you can use the built-in Python from Terminal:

	[ /usr/bin/python3 -m tkinter ]

If you’re using a virtual environment, make sure it’s configured to use the system’s Python installation that comes with tkinter

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) **Install tkinter on Windows:**

If you’re using Windows, tkinter should be available by default with your Python installation. If it’s not, you might need to repair your Python installation or ensure that tkinter is selected during installation.
